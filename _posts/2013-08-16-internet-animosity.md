Phil Fish is the kind of developer that I have an endless amount of respect for. He's the kind of developer that gets so invested in their projects that in your mind it becomes difficult to separate them from their work. Linus Torvalds is another example. There are lots of things to criticize about Torvalds but you can't question his dedication to Linux.

It was a bit disturbing, then, to read Fish's <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/phil-fish-has-meltdown-on-twitter-rashly-cancels-fez-ii-258869.phtml" target="_blank">recent comments</a>, and to hear that he's leaving the video game industry. He followed up with an explanation posted to Polytron's website:

<blockquote><p>FEZ II is cancelled
i am done.
i take the money and i run.
this is as much as i can stomach.
this isn't the result of any one big thing, but the end of a long, bloody campaign.
you win.</p></blockquote>
Programmers can sometimes lose the passion they have for their craft, and that's sad but completely understandable. That wasn't the case here. This was instead the result of pointless mean-spirited abuse from internet commenters. It's unfortunate that the anonymity provided by the internet can reduce otherwise decent people to childish immaturity. Would any of us tell him "you suck, your games suck, everything about you sucks" if we saw him on the street? No, because we're not dicks. 

Fish has never been entirely emotionally stable and he could definitely handle criticism a lot better than he does. But even if you didn't like him or his work, what is there to gain from him being pushed out of the industry? This really is one of those scenarios where everybody loses.
