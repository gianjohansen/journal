A recurring rumor surrounding the upcoming release of Samsung's 2016 flagship Galaxy S7 is whether they'll act on their "will they, won't they" relationship with Qualcomm. Samsung ditched Qualcomm's Snapdragon in favour of its own in-house ARM-based Exynos, with the launch of their S6 in 2015. With the upcoming Snapdragon 820's release it might be a good time to rethink that decision. There's a lot to like about Qualcomm's new SoC.

**X12 LTE modem**

Qualcomm has always been a leader in wireless radio tech and they're continuing that trend by integrating their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/modems/x12">X12 LTE modem</a> into the 820. The chip has a theoretical max download speed of up to 600Mbps and upload of up to 150Mbps. That's definitely a welcome improvement over the Snapdragon 810's X10, which offers 450Mbps and 50Mbps respectively.

**Kryo's Debut**

Qualcomm's 64-bit Kryo CPU will be shipped for the first time in the 820. Switching to Kryo (2.2GHz, Quad Core) will mean that the 820 will have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9595/qualcomm-announces-kryo-cpu-details-22-ghz-14nm-finfet">twice the CPU performance</a> of its predecessor.

**3x Carrier Aggregation**

The 820 further improves support for carrier aggregation by allowing carriers to merge unlicensed and licensed LTE spectrums (LTE-U) to more efficiently use their available bandwidth. This is carrier dependent but at least <a target="_blank" href="https://media.optus.com.au/media-releases/2015/optus-switches-on-3x-carrier-aggregation-in-melbourne-cbd/">one telco</a> has begun rolling it out here in Australia (the rollout is a bit slower <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2015/07/27/carrier-aggregation-an-opportunity-for-operators-and-handset-oems-but-is-the-u-s-behind/">in the US</a>).

**4x4 MIMO Support**

With the addition of a couple of new antennas the Snapdragon 820 supports 4x4 MIMO and is expected to be the first mobile platform to support 802.11ac Multi-User MIMO. That means better throughput and a more reliable connection. Cisco have a <a target="_blank" href="https://meraki.cisco.com/blog/2011/02/mimo-why-multiple-antennas-matter/">good explanation</a> on why that is.

**Image Processing**

The next-generation Adreno 530 GPUs that will ship with the 820 are expected to show a performance improvement of 40% over the 810's 430 as well as a 40% reduction in power consumption. It's image signal processor will also be getting a huge upgrade, to their new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2015/08/12/qualcomm-introduces-next-generation-gpu-architecture-and-image-signal">Spectra ISP</a>, which supports up to three cameras and "up to 25 megapixels at 30 frames per second with zero shutter lag".

## But is it enough?

Losing Samsung as a client would have definitely hurt for Qualcomm and on paper the 820 looks like a good response. It's up to them now to deliver on that.
