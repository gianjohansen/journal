QR codes are ugly. Yes, they're practical, versatile and a fantastic way to bridge the offline-online gap, but from an aesthetic point of view they're just plain dull. But do they have to be? QR codes are designed to be used out in the real world and so need to be able to shrug off a certain amount of damage while still remaining functional. That error correction can be exploited to create visually distinct codes that can make those typical black-and-white-boxes seem more archaic than print news.

## Why It Works
Let's say that one day I get the urge to listen to a CD (yeah, I know, just go with it), only to find that there's a scratch running across the entire length of the disk. I put the disk into my computer and hit play, praying that it'll be okay but fearing deep down that it won't. As if by magic, the tracks all play fine. The bits that were scratched out are too obscured to read, so how is it that the music is still intact? For that, we can thank Reed-Solomon error correction.

Reed-Solomon codes are a type of error correction where extra parity bits are added to the normal data stream. These parity bits ("check symbols" in this case) are generated by calculating a series of polynomials using inputs from the data, thereby providing a redundancy that allows for the data to be recreated in future when an error is detected. Think of it as though those symbols describe the data, so even if that data is lost we can work backwards to rebuild it. When an error is detected, we find its location (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien_search" target="_blank">Chien's search algorithm</a>) and its value (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forney_algorithm" target="_blank">Forney algorithm</a>), and then add the correct values to the corrupted values.

QR codes use this principle by adding error correcting sections to whatever data you've stored in the code, allowing a maximum possible error correction of up to 30%. You could literally lose up to a third of the code and still be able to scan it. This makes them robust enough to handle a bit of wear and tear... plus a bit of personalization.

## 30% Prettier Codes?
QR codes were originally created for the automotive industry to allow car manufacturers to quickly identify components, and their default look clearly emphasises function over form. "Designer QR codes" are what you get when you add a bit of artistic flair to that default look. Compare the QR code on the left here (a standard QR code pointing to http://www.reslabs.com.au) to the two personalised ones for Merge 104.8 and Imax:

The codes on the right are much more visually appealing, which means they're more likely to attract attention, which means more scans. So how do we create one?

## The Not-So-Easy Way
If you want something totally unique, photoshop is where you need to be. You'll need to go to an online service such as <a href="http://goqr.me/" target="_blank">goqr</a> to create the basic code, making sure that it has the maximum 30% error correction. You can tell what percentage a code is using by the bits to the right of the lower left positioning box ('H' is 30%):

What you need to remember when designing your code is that not all the bits on the code can be changed. Some of the bits are used as metadata that describe how the rest of the code should be interpreted, and need to be left alone.

The above image from wikipedia shows which parts of a QR code are safe to edit and which aren't. The greyed areas contain the actual data, and so it's just a case of editing there and making sure to keep 70% of the bits.

You can also use colour to make your code unique. You can recolour any of the bits, as long as you stick to dark-on-light and make sure that there's enough contrast that it can be scanned.

And remember, it's important to rescan the code often while editing to make sure that any changes haven't made the code unscannable. 

## The Slightly Easier Way
There are several online QR code generators that offer some customization. The most impressive i've found is <a href="http://www.qrhacker.com" target="_blank">QRhacker</a>. It offers a WYSIWIG editor that lets you add backgrounds, change colours, overlay images and modify the code pixel-by-pixel.

Of course, designing using a service like that is similar to using a wordpress theme for your website: it'll be unique enough for most cases but is too limited to be really special. And note that the caveats I mentioned earlier also apply here. Prepare for a whole lot of trial-and-error.

There's a real lack of creativity in how most QR codes are used. Like any new technology it'll take a while before we really understand how to make full use of their potential. Making them stand out like this so that they're not visually indistinct from regular barcodes is a good start.
