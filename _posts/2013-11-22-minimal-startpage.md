I whipped up <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gianjohansen/startpage">a very simple startpage</a> earlier today because I couldn't really find what I wanted in Chrome's extensions gallery. A startpage should exist purely to forward you to more interesting content with a minimum amount of fuss, so if your startpage is telling me which celebrities have birthdays today then I don't think it's really doing its job.

You'll obviously want to customize the links yourself, change the weather area to your city and maybe play around with how the page looks, and then host it somewhere. I don't have a hosted version you can use but ideally you should have it as a local file so that it's as fast as possible.

You can find the startpage <a href="https://github.com/gianjohansen/startpage" target="_blank">on my github</a>.
