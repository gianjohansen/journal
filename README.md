# gianjohansen.github.io

This is my blog.

It used to be self-hosted but I decided to move it to GitHub on the recommendation of a few friends.

It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is something I would definitely recommend for simpler projects like this.

The current design is based on the fantastic [Lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) by [Matt Swanson](https://github.com/swanson).
